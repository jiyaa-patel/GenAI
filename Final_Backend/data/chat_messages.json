The rent of ₹18,000 is due on or before the 5th of every month.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key due dates and consequences mentioned in the document:\n\n* **Monthly Rent:**  ₹18,000 is due on or before the 5th of each month.  This is crucial; missing this date has consequences.\n\n* **Late Rent Consequences:** If the rent is not paid for three months, *or* if the tenant breaks any other part of the agreement, the landlord has the right to:\n    1. End the lease agreement.\n    2. Evict the tenant.\n    3. Take back possession of the property.\n\n    *However*, the landlord *must* give the tenant a written notice of their intention to do so.  The tenant then has 15 days from receiving this notice to pay any overdue rent and/or fix any breaches of the agreement. If the tenant does this within the 15 days, the landlord cannot evict them.\n\n* **Other Bills:**  The tenant is responsible for paying electricity, shared maintenance, and water bills directly to the service providers.  There are no specific due dates mentioned for these, but they should be paid promptly to avoid service disruptions.\n\n* **Deposit Return:** The ₹36,000 deposit will be returned to the tenant when they move out and leave the property.  There is no specific due date for this, only that it will happen simultaneously with the tenant vacating the premises.\n\n\nIn short, the most important due date is the 5th of each month for the rent.  Failing to meet this deadline, along with other potential breaches of contract, could lead to eviction.\n",

      "content": "Hi,\n\nI understand you'd like me to explain parts of a lease agreement.  Let's break down the sections you provided:\n\n**Section 8: Repairs**\n\n* **Minor Repairs:** You're responsible for small, everyday fixes like replacing lightbulbs, fixing leaky faucets, or dealing with a blown fuse.\n* **Major Repairs:**  The landlord (Lessor) is responsible for major repairs like structural damage, problems with the electrical system, plumbing leaks, or water damage.\n* **Landlord's Failure to Repair:** If the landlord doesn't fix major problems after you've notified them, you can fix it yourself and they must reimburse you.\n\n**Section 9: Landlord Inspections:**\n\nThe landlord or their representative has the right to inspect the property, but only at a time that's convenient for both of you.\n\n**Section 10: Tenant Responsibilities:**\n\nYou must take care of the property and return it in good condition when you move out. Normal wear and tear is acceptable, but you're responsible for any damage beyond that, unless it's caused by things like fire, flood, or an act of God.\n\n**Section 11: Rent:**\n\nYou agree to pay ₹18,000 in rent each month.  This payment must be made in advance by the 5th of each month.\n\n\n**Section 12: Late Rent:**\n\nIf rent isn't paid within 15 days of the notice, the landlord *cannot* immediately evict you.  This means they'll likely pursue other legal means to recover the rent.\n\n**Section 13: Utilities & Shared Costs:**\n\nYou are responsible for paying your own electricity, water, and any shared building maintenance fees directly to the service providers.  The meter readings at the start of your lease are provided as a baseline.\n\n**Section 14: Security Deposit:**\n\nYou paid a ₹36,000 security deposit. This will be returned to you when you move out, provided you've fulfilled all the terms of the lease agreement and left the property in good condition (accounting for normal wear and tear).  The deposit earns no interest.\n\n\nIn short, this lease agreement outlines your responsibilities for maintaining the property, paying rent and utilities, and your rights regarding repairs and the security deposit.  If anything remains unclear, please feel free to ask more specific questions.\n",

      "content": "Based on the provided excerpt,  there's nothing explicitly stated that would automatically cause you problems as the tenant, *provided you follow the terms of the agreement*. However, let's break down what could potentially cause issues, and how to avoid them:\n\n**Potential Problems and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n* **Breaching the Lease:**  The most common way to run into trouble is by not following the rules of the lease.  The document clearly states:\n\n    * **No Subletting:** You can't rent out the property to someone else, even a part of it.\n    * **Residential Use Only:** You can only use the property for living, not for a business or anything else.\n    * **No Alterations:** You can't make changes to the building's structure. You *can* install and remove your own things (like shelves or pictures), but only if you don't damage the property.\n    * **Paying Bills:** You're responsible for paying your own electricity, water, and shared maintenance fees directly to the utility companies.  Make sure to keep records of your payments.\n    * **Giving Notice:** If you want to leave before the 11 months are up, you must give the landlord one month's written notice.\n\n    **To avoid problems:**  Carefully read and understand *all* the terms.  Keep a copy of the lease agreement and follow it meticulously.\n\n\n* **Damage to the Property:** The landlord is responsible for the property's working condition at the start of the lease and its return to that condition (minus normal wear and tear, damage from natural disasters, etc.) at the end.  However, you are responsible for any damage you cause beyond normal wear and tear.\n\n    **To avoid problems:**  Treat the property with respect. Report any existing problems immediately, and take care to prevent damage. Document any damage that you did *not* cause when you move in. Take photos as evidence.\n\n\n* **Deposit:** You've paid a security deposit.  This will be returned when you move out, provided you've fulfilled all the lease terms and left the property in good condition (normal wear and tear excepted).\n\n    **To avoid problems:** Get a receipt for the deposit and keep it safe. When you move out, ensure the landlord inspects the property with you to document the condition and agree on the return of your deposit.\n\n\n* **Late Payments:** While not explicitly stated regarding rent,  any late payment (rent or otherwise) could cause problems. Always pay your bills on time.\n\n\n**In short:**  As long as you understand and adhere to the terms of the lease agreement – particularly those outlined above – you should not encounter any problems.  If you are unsure about anything, it is best to clarify it with the landlord in writing before proceeding.  Keeping good records (photos, receipts, communication records) is crucial in preventing disputes.\n",
