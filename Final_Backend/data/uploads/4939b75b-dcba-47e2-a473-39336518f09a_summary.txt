==================================================
This Loan Agreement, executed on August 19, 2025, in Mumbai, outlines a ₹300,000 personal loan from Mr. Ramesh Iyer to Mr. Prakash Deshmukh.  The loan, disbursed via HDFC Bank, carries an 11% annual interest rate, calculated monthly. Repayment involves 15 monthly installments of approximately ₹22,000, commencing September 5, 2025.  The original Sale Deed of Plot No. 27 in Pune serves as collateral.

Crucially, the agreement permits prepayment without penalty.  However, default on two consecutive EMIs triggers immediate repayment of the entire loan, plus a 2% monthly penal interest on overdue amounts.  The borrower is obligated to maintain the collateral free from encumbrances and notify the lender of any address changes.

The lender retains the right to recover dues by enforcing the collateral or initiating legal proceedings.  Disputes will be resolved through arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, in Mumbai.  Mumbai courts hold exclusive jurisdiction. The agreement's duration is 15 months, potentially terminating earlier via prepayment or sooner due to default.  The agreement’s special condition is the use of the Sale Deed as collateral, securing the lender's position.  Two witnesses, Suresh Nair and Kavita Shetty, attest to the agreement.
