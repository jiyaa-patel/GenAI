This Employment Agreement outlines the terms of employment for Rohan Sharma as a Software Developer at TechSolutions Private Limited, effective August 20, 2025.  His responsibilities include performing assigned duties, maintaining company dignity, adhering to laws and policies, reporting to his manager, and refraining from unauthorized commitments on the company's behalf.  He will receive an annual CTC of ₹6,00,000, paid according to the company's payroll policy.

A six-month probationary period applies, during which employment may be terminated without cause with advance notice (except as legally mandated).  The agreement is at-will, terminable by either party.  The employee must provide one month's written notice to resign; however, early resignation within two years incurs a ₹2,00,000 penalty.  The employer may terminate without notice for misconduct or breach of contract.  If the employee leaves within six months of training, training costs will be recovered.  Specific details regarding working hours, leave, and holidays are not explicitly stated in this document and will be governed by the Company's Employee Guidelines.

The agreement includes strict confidentiality and non-compete clauses.  Mr. Sharma cannot disclose confidential information or work for a competing business for three years post-termination, with violation incurring liability under Sections 73 & 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.  Disputes will be resolved through arbitration by Mr. Suresh Mehta under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, in Jaipur.  The agreement is governed by the laws of Jaipur, Rajasthan.
