This Employment Agreement outlines the terms of employment for Rohan Sharma as a Software Developer at TechSolutions Private Limited, effective August 20, 2025.  His responsibilities include performing assigned duties, maintaining company dignity, adhering to laws and company policies, reporting to his manager, and refraining from committing to obligations on behalf of the company without consent.  His annual CTC salary is ₹6,00,000, paid according to company payroll policy.

A six-month probationary period applies, during which employment may be terminated by the company without cause with advance notice (except as legally mandated).  The employee may resign with one month’s written notice; however, early resignation within two years incurs a ₹2,00,000 penalty. The employer may terminate without notice for misconduct or breach of contract.  Should the employee leave within six months of training, training expenses are recoverable.  Specific details regarding working hours, leave, and holidays are not explicitly stated but are covered under the Company’s Employee Guidelines.

The agreement includes strict confidentiality and non-compete clauses.  The employee must not disclose confidential information or work for a competing business for three years post-termination, facing legal action under sections 73 & 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 for violations.  Any disputes will be resolved through arbitration by Mr. Suresh Mehta under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in Jaipur.  The agreement is governed by the laws of Jaipur, Rajasthan.
