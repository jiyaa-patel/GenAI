==================================================
This Loan Agreement, executed August 19, 2025, in Mumbai, outlines a personal loan of ₹3,00,000 from Mr. Ramesh Iyer (Lender) to Mr. Prakash Deshmukh (Borrower).  The loan, disbursed via HDFC Bank, accrues 11% annual interest, calculated monthly.  Repayment involves 15 equal monthly installments (EMIs) of ₹22,000 commencing September 5, 2025.

Crucially, the Borrower provides the original Sale Deed of Plot No. 27, Pune Municipal Area, as collateral.  Prepayment is allowed without penalty.  However, default on two consecutive EMIs triggers immediate repayment of the entire loan, plus a 2% monthly penal interest on overdue amounts.  The Borrower covenants to maintain the collateral free from encumbrances and notify the Lender of address changes.

The Lender retains the right to recover dues by enforcing the collateral or initiating legal proceedings.  Dispute resolution is governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, with arbitration in Mumbai.  Mumbai courts hold exclusive jurisdiction. The agreement's duration is 15 months, terminating upon full repayment or default leading to immediate repayment.  The agreement is specifically between two Indian individuals, highlighting its domestic legal context.
