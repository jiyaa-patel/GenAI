This summary outlines the key terms of the residential rental agreement between Mr. Rajesh Kumar Patel (Lessor) and Mr. Ankit Sharma (Lessee) for Flat 203, Green Residency, Prahladnagar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat – 380051.  The agreement covers an 11-month period commencing September 1st, 2025.  The monthly rent is ₹18,000, payable in advance by the 5th of each month.  The agreement is silent on security deposit details.

The Lessee has the option to terminate the lease with one month's written notice.  There is no stated lock-in period beyond the initial 11 months, nor are renewal terms specified.  The agreement doesn't detail penalties for late rent payments.

The Lessee is obligated to use the premises (a 2BHK apartment, 1100 sq ft) solely for residential purposes, maintain the property in good condition (excluding normal wear and tear and damage caused by force majeure), and perform minor repairs at their own expense.  The Lessor is responsible for major repairs and ensuring the initial functionality of utilities.  The Lessor retains the right to inspect the premises at mutually convenient times.  Subletting or assignment of the lease is strictly prohibited.  The Lessor guarantees the working condition of sanitary, electrical, and water connections upon handover, with the exception of reasonable wear and tear.

This summary highlights critical terms affecting the Lessee; however, a full review of the original agreement is advised for complete understanding of all rights and obligations.  The absence of details regarding security deposit and late fees warrants further clarification.
