The lease covers a 750 sq. ft. commercial space and runs for 11 months, from September 1st, 2025, to July 31st, 2026.

The monthly rent is ₹45,000, payable in advance by the 5th of each month via bank transfer to the Lessor's HDFC Bank account.  A ₹1,50,000 security deposit is required.  This is refundable within 15 days of vacating, less any deductions for damages or outstanding dues.  Late rent payments incur a ₹1,000 penalty per month, and dishonored checks result in a ₹750 penalty.

The Lessee is responsible for all utilities (electricity, water, internet) and day-to-day maintenance and cleaning. The Lessor handles property tax and structural repairs.  Subletting is prohibited without written consent.  The Lessor retains the right to inspect the premises with 24-hour notice.  Both parties can terminate the lease with 30 days' written notice; failure to vacate after termination incurs double the monthly rent.  Renewal is possible by mutual agreement with new terms. The premises are for commercial use only.  A force majeure clause protects both parties from liabilities due to uncontrollable events.
