==================================================
This Loan Agreement, executed on August 19, 2025, in Mumbai, outlines a ₹3,00,000 personal loan from Mr. Ramesh Iyer to Mr. Prakash Deshmukh.  The loan, disbursed via HDFC Bank, accrues 11% annual interest, calculated monthly.  Repayment is structured as 15 monthly EMIs of ₹22,000, commencing September 5, 2025.

Crucially, Mr. Deshmukh provides the original sale deed of Plot No. 27, Pune Municipal Area, as collateral.  Prepayment is allowed without penalty.  However, default on two consecutive EMIs triggers immediate repayment of the entire loan, plus a 2% monthly penalty on overdue amounts.

Mr. Deshmukh is obligated to maintain the collateral free from encumbrances and promptly notify Mr. Iyer of address changes.  Mr. Iyer retains the right to recover dues by enforcing the collateral or initiating legal proceedings.  The agreement stipulates arbitration in Mumbai under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, for dispute resolution, with exclusive jurisdiction residing in Mumbai courts.  The loan's duration is 15 months, terminating upon full repayment or default.  The agreement's special condition centers on the collateral security and its implications for both parties in case of default.
