==================================================
This Loan Agreement, executed on August 19, 2025, in Mumbai, outlines a personal loan of ₹300,000 from Mr. Ramesh Iyer to Mr. Prakash Deshmukh.  The loan, disbursed via HDFC Bank, is repayable in 15 monthly installments of ₹22,000 commencing September 5, 2025.  An annual interest rate of 11%, calculated monthly, applies.  The agreement stipulates that early repayment incurs no penalty.

Crucially, Mr. Deshmukh provides the original Sale Deed of Plot No. 27, Pune Municipal Area, as collateral.  His obligations include maintaining the collateral free from encumbrances, promptly notifying Mr. Iyer of address changes, and adhering to the repayment schedule.  Defaulting on two consecutive EMIs triggers immediate repayment of the entire loan plus a 2% monthly penalty on overdue amounts.

Mr. Iyer retains the right to recover dues by enforcing the collateral and pursuing legal action if necessary.  Dispute resolution will occur through arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, in Mumbai.  Mumbai courts hold exclusive jurisdiction.  The agreement's duration is 15 months, terminating upon full repayment or default.  The special condition is the use of the land deed as collateral security for the loan.  Both parties signed the agreement, witnessed by Suresh Nair and Kavita Shetty.
