==================================================
This Employment Agreement, effective August 20, 2025, outlines the terms of employment for Mr. Rohan Sharma as a Software Developer with TechSolutions Private Limited, based in Jaipur, Rajasthan.  His annual CTC is ₹6,00,000.  

The agreement includes a six-month probationary period, during which employment may be terminated by the company without cause with advance notice, except as legally mandated.  After successful completion, he will attain regular employee status. His responsibilities include performing assigned duties, maintaining company dignity, adhering to laws and company policies, reporting to his manager, and refraining from committing the company without consent.  He will be primarily based in Jaipur but may be transferred to other locations within India and may work at client sites.


The agreement specifies a one-month written notice period for resignation; however, early resignation within two years incurs a ₹2,00,000 penalty.  The employer may terminate without notice for misconduct or breach of contract.  If the employee leaves within six months of training, training costs will be recovered.  

The agreement includes robust confidentiality and non-compete clauses.  Mr. Sharma must protect confidential information and intellectual property, and he cannot work for a competing business for three years post-termination, with legal recourse under Section 73 & 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 for any violation.  Disputes will be resolved through arbitration by Mr. Suresh Mehta, under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The agreement is governed by the laws of Jaipur, Rajasthan.  Specific details regarding working hours, leave, and holidays are not explicitly included but are presumably covered by the company's employee guidelines.
