==================================================
This Loan Agreement, executed on August 19, 2025, in Mumbai, outlines a ₹3,00,000 personal loan from Mr. Ramesh Iyer to Mr. Prakash Deshmukh.  The loan, disbursed via HDFC Bank, accrues 11% annual interest, calculated monthly.  Repayment involves 15 equal monthly installments (EMIs) of ₹22,000, commencing September 5, 2025.  Crucially, the loan is secured by the original sale deed of Plot No. 27 in Pune, which the borrower must keep free from encumbrances.

The borrower has the right to prepay the loan without penalty.  However, default on two consecutive EMIs triggers immediate repayment of the entire loan, plus a 2% monthly penalty on overdue amounts.  The borrower is obligated to promptly notify the lender of any address changes.  The lender retains the right to recover dues by enforcing the collateral or through legal proceedings.

The agreement specifies that disputes will be resolved through arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, in Mumbai.  Mumbai courts hold exclusive jurisdiction.  The loan's duration is 15 months, terminating upon full repayment or default, triggering the lender's enforcement rights.  The agreement’s special condition lies in the use of the Pune plot as collateral, highlighting a significant risk for the borrower.
