==================================================
This document details a C programming project for a Timetable Generator application.  The project aims to automate timetable creation for educational institutions, addressing the complexities of resource allocation (teachers, subjects, time slots) and minimizing scheduling conflicts.  Key objectives include efficiency, scalability (handling various institution sizes), flexibility (customizable constraints for students and faculty), and error minimization.

The core algorithm involves inputting the number of subjects, subject names, and a choice between student or faculty-focused timetable generation.  For student timetables, a randomized subject allocation across days and time slots is implemented.  Faculty timetables incorporate subject selection and division allocation via user input and a switch-case structure.  The program uses a 6x8 table (days x time slots) to represent the timetable. Error handling is included for invalid inputs.

The provided code snippet shows functions for randomizing subject allocation (`randomSubject`) and the main function for user input, subject entry, timetable generation based on the selected mode (student or faculty), and timetable display.  The code uses standard C libraries for input/output, string manipulation, random number generation, and time functions.  No financial terms, penalties, durations, or termination provisions are present; this is a purely functional software description.  The special condition is the limitation of a maximum of 7 subjects.
