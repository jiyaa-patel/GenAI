==================================================
This document is a completion certificate issued by AWS Training & Certification, confirming DivyMevada's successful completion of the "Introduction to Generative AI - Art of the Possible" training course on June 29, 2025.  The certificate was awarded by Michelle Vaz, Director of AWS Training & Certification.

The document itself does not outline key terms and conditions, obligations, rights, financial terms, penalties, duration, termination provisions, or special conditions related to the course or certification. It serves solely as proof of course completion.  Therefore, any such details would need to be sourced from the separate training agreement or terms of service that DivyMevada presumably accepted prior to enrolling in the course.  

To understand the full legal implications surrounding this training, including potential refund policies, intellectual property rights concerning course materials, or any restrictions on the use of the certification, it is essential to refer to the original training agreement.  This certificate alone provides only evidence of course completion and lacks the crucial contextual legal framework.  Without access to the associated terms and conditions, a comprehensive legal analysis of associated rights and obligations is impossible.  The certificate does not imply any specific license or warranty beyond acknowledging successful course participation.
