==================================================
This Loan Agreement, executed on August 19, 2025, in Mumbai, outlines a ₹300,000 personal loan from Mr. Ramesh Iyer to Mr. Prakash Deshmukh.  The loan, disbursed via HDFC Bank, accrues 11% annual interest, calculated monthly.  Repayment is structured as 15 equal monthly installments (EMIs) of ₹22,000, commencing September 5, 2025.  The loan is secured by the original sale deed of Plot No. 27 in Pune.

Crucially, the agreement permits prepayment without penalty.  However, defaulting on two consecutive EMIs triggers immediate repayment of the entire loan, plus a 2% monthly penalty on overdue amounts.  The borrower, Mr. Deshmukh, covenants to maintain the collateral free from encumbrances and to notify the lender of address changes.  Mr. Iyer, the lender, retains the right to recover dues by enforcing the collateral or through legal action.

The agreement stipulates that disputes will be resolved through arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, in Mumbai.  Mumbai courts possess exclusive jurisdiction. The loan's duration is 15 months, terminating upon full repayment or default.  The agreement highlights the security provided by the sale deed as a significant condition, alongside the clear stipulations regarding default and subsequent penalties.  The specified jurisdiction and dispute resolution mechanism are also key aspects of this legally binding document.
