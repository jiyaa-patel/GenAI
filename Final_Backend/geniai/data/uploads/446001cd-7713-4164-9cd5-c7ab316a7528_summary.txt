==================================================
This Employment Agreement outlines the terms of employment for Rohan Sharma as a Software Developer at TechSolutions Private Limited, effective August 20, 2025.  His responsibilities include performing assigned duties, maintaining company dignity, adhering to laws and policies, reporting to his manager, and refraining from committing the company without consent.  His annual CTC is ₹6,00,000.

A six-month probationary period applies, during which employment may be terminated without cause with advance notice.  The agreement is ongoing until terminated by either party. The employee must provide one month's written notice to resign; however, resignation within two years incurs a ₹2,00,000 penalty. The employer may terminate without notice for misconduct or breach of contract.  If the employee leaves within six months of training, training costs will be recovered.  Specific details regarding working hours, leave, and holidays are not explicitly stated in this agreement but are presumably outlined in the Company's Employee Guidelines.

The agreement includes strict confidentiality and non-compete clauses.  The employee cannot disclose confidential information or work for a competing business for three years post-termination, with potential liability under Sections 73 & 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.  Disputes are to be resolved through arbitration by Mr. Suresh Mehta under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, in Jaipur, using the Hindi language.  The agreement is governed by the laws of Jaipur, Rajasthan.
