There are no explicit key terms and conditions, obligations, rights, financial terms, or penalties detailed within the provided text. The document solely serves as proof of course completion and lacks any contractual stipulations.  Therefore, no duration or termination provisions are present.  No special conditions are mentioned.

The certificate itself does not represent a legally binding agreement.  It is simply a record of participation and successful completion of a training course.  Further contractual details, if any, pertaining to the course enrollment, payment, or any associated agreements would need to be sourced from separate documentation, such as a course registration form or terms of service agreement.  Absence of such accompanying documentation limits the analysis to the scope of the provided completion certificate.  The certificate only confirms the successful completion of the stated course by DivyMevada and is not a legally binding contract.
