==================================================
This document details a C programming project: a Timetable Generator designed for educational institutions.  The primary objective is to automate timetable creation, minimizing conflicts and optimizing resource allocation (teachers, subjects, time slots).  The program prioritizes efficiency, scalability (handling various institution sizes), flexibility (customizable constraints for students and faculty), and error minimization through adherence to predefined constraints.

The algorithm involves inputting the number of subjects and their names.  Users choose between a student-focused or faculty-focused timetable generation.  The student mode randomly assigns subjects to time slots, while the faculty mode allows for manual subject input per division. A 6x8 table (days x time slots) stores the timetable.  The C code includes functions for random subject assignment (`randomSubject`) and timetable display.  The code incorporates error handling for invalid input (e.g., exceeding the maximum number of subjects).

The document includes a flowchart visually representing the program's logic.  The provided code snippet shows parts of the implementation, demonstrating array manipulation and random number generation for subject scheduling.  No financial terms, penalties, duration, termination provisions, or special conditions are specified, as this is a purely technical project description rather than a legal agreement.
