==================================================
This document analyzes the Government of India Act 1935 and the Indian Constitution, highlighting key features and influences.  The 1935 Act introduced provincial autonomy, a proposed (but unrealized) All-India Federation, bicameral legislatures, and continued separate electorates, while maintaining significant power for the Governor-General.  The Indian Constitution, the world's longest written constitution, is described as a blend of rigidity and flexibility in its amendment process.  It draws heavily from the 1935 Act, but also incorporates elements from various other constitutions, including the British, US, Canadian, Irish, and Australian models.

The Constitution establishes a federal system with a unitary bias, featuring a parliamentary form of government with a nominal and real executive, responsible to the legislature.  A synthesis of parliamentary sovereignty and judicial supremacy ensures checks and balances.  An integrated and independent judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, safeguards citizens' rights.  Fundamental Rights, encompassing six broad categories, protect civil liberties and are enforceable by the courts.  There are no financial terms, penalties, duration, or termination provisions specifically mentioned in relation to either the 1935 Act or the Constitution within this provided text.  The special condition of the "Union of States" rather than a federation is emphasized.
