==================================================
This document is a completion certificate issued by AWS Training & Certification, signed by Michelle Vaz, Director,  to DivyMevada on June 29, 2025, for the course "Introduction to Generative AI - Art of the Possible."  The certificate itself does not contain terms and conditions, obligations, rights, financial details, or termination provisions.  It solely serves as evidence of course completion.

Therefore, a comprehensive legal analysis based solely on the provided certificate is impossible.  To ascertain such details, one would need to refer to the associated course agreement or terms of service. These supplementary documents would likely outline:

* **Key Terms and Conditions:**  Details regarding the course content, access policies, acceptable use of materials, and intellectual property rights.
* **Obligations and Rights:**  The student's obligations (e.g., adhering to course policies) and the training provider's rights (e.g., intellectual property ownership).
* **Financial Terms and Penalties:** The course fee, payment terms, refund policies, and potential penalties for violations of the agreement.
* **Duration and Termination:**  The duration of access to course materials and circumstances under which the agreement might be terminated by either party.
* **Special Conditions:** Any specific stipulations, such as limitations of liability, dispute resolution mechanisms, or governing law.

In conclusion, this completion certificate is only a partial record. A complete legal analysis requires access to the full agreement governing the participation in the AWS training course.
