==================================================
This document details a C programming project: a Timetable Generator for educational institutions.  The primary objective is to create an automated, conflict-free timetable for classes and teachers, optimizing resource allocation and minimizing manual effort.  The program addresses scalability, supporting various data sizes, and flexibility, allowing customization for student or faculty use.  Error minimization is achieved through adherence to predefined constraints.

The core algorithm involves inputting the number of subjects, subject names, and a choice between student or faculty timetable generation.  For student timetables, subjects are randomly assigned to time slots. Faculty timetables allow for manual input of subject and division allocations.  A 6x8 table (days x time slots) stores the timetable. The C code implements this logic, utilizing functions like `randomSubject` for random assignment and `strcpy` for string manipulation.  Error handling includes checks for exceeding the maximum number of subjects (7).

The document includes a basic flowchart outlining the program's flow and a partial code snippet showcasing the random subject assignment and timetable construction.  No financial terms, penalties, duration, or termination provisions are present, as this is a technical project description rather than a legal agreement.  There are no specific obligations or rights outlined beyond the functional requirements of the timetable generator itself.
