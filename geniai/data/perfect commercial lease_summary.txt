==================================================
This summary analyzes the commercial lease agreement between Mr. Suresh Kumar Iyer (Lessor) and Mr. Abhishek Reddy (Lessee), effective September 1st, 2025, for Shop No. 7, Orion Business Park, Outer Ring Road, Bengaluru – 560037.  The lease term is 11 months, ending July 31st, 2026.  Monthly rent is ₹45,000, payable in advance by the 5th of each month via bank transfer to the Lessor's HDFC Bank account.  A ₹1,50,000 security deposit is required, refundable within 15 days of vacating, less any deductions.

The premises are for office/commercial use only; subletting is prohibited without written consent.  Late rent incurs a ₹1,000 penalty per month, and cheque dishonor a ₹750 penalty.  The Lessee is responsible for utilities and minor repairs, while the Lessor handles property tax and structural repairs.  The Lessor has inspection rights with 24-hour notice.  Either party can terminate with 30 days' written notice; failure to vacate results in double monthly rent charges.  The lease may be renewed by mutual agreement, with new terms.  The Lessee indemnifies the Lessor against any losses arising from the premises' use.  Force majeure events excuse non-performance.  No specific lock-in period beyond the initial 11 months is explicitly stated.
