==================================================
This Loan Agreement, dated August 19, 2025, outlines a personal loan of ₹3,00,000 from Mr. Ramesh Iyer (Lender) to Mr. Prakash Deshmukh (Borrower).  The loan, disbursed via HDFC Bank, accrues 11% annual interest, calculated monthly. Repayment is structured as 15 equal monthly installments (EMIs) of ₹22,000, commencing September 5, 2025.  The Borrower provides the original sale deed of Plot No. 27, Pune Municipal Area, as collateral.

Crucially, the agreement allows for prepayment without penalty. However, default on two consecutive EMIs triggers immediate repayment of the entire loan, plus a 2% monthly penalty on overdue amounts.  The Borrower covenants to maintain the collateral free from encumbrances and notify the Lender of address changes.  The Lender retains the right to recover dues by enforcing the collateral or initiating legal proceedings.

The loan agreement's duration is 15 months, terminating upon full repayment.  Dispute resolution is governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, with arbitration in Mumbai.  Mumbai courts hold exclusive jurisdiction.  The agreement is witnessed by Suresh Nair and Kavita Shetty.  The specific location and nature of the collateral (Plot No. 27) represent a notable condition, impacting the Lender's recourse in case of default.
